Working with this project i have learned asynchronous javascript meaning that you kinda can execute muliple function at the same time. Javascript it self is a single thread language meaning that its execute very line of code line by line. But when you write asynchronous code you can put it ouside the javascript v8 engine and into the webApi and once it finished it get qued and push back to the callback stack.

In the process i have also learn how to use promises and .then and .catch resolve and reject. I have also learned that there is a simplier alternative to promises and that its async function (but it still based of promises, it just look cleaner). And lastly i have understoof how to interacte with apis.
